Autism prevalence has risen to **1 in 31 children** in the U.S., with access to quality care remaining a significant challenge. Research demonstrates that Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy significantly improves outcomes for children with autism. However, disparities in access, workforce challenges, and funding limitations often lead to **inconsistent quality of care**.

The **commercialization of autism care** has exacerbated these challenges. Many for-profit ABA providers **prioritize financial growth over clinical quality**. High turnover rates among behavior specialists, cost-cutting measures, and leadership with little to no clinical expertise have created an industry that **focuses on billables rather than skill acquisition and behavioral improvement**. Additionally, despite ethical concerns, the ever-increasing **demand for academic performance and conformity** has created a push for providers to use ABA in **enforcing social normative behaviors**, instead of nurturing the child’s unique potential. As a result, **the best professionals leave the field** or move out of network, **making quality autism care increasingly inaccessible**.

Our mission is to **make high-quality, evidence-based, child-centered autism care accessible** to all families by developing a sustainable, community-centered model that **prioritizes clinical excellence**. We achieve this by **hiring and retaining passionate behavior specialists** at competitive rates while supplementing insurance reimbursements with additional funding sources only available to nonprofit organizations. By removing financial barriers and focusing on each child’s unique strengths, we aim to provide **equitable, consistent, and effective care for all children** with autism, regardless of socioeconomic status.

#### Ethical ABA
We practice a progressive form of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) that honors the dignity of every child. We emphasize the **least restrictive intervention** possible, applying just enough support to help your child thrive without overwhelming them.
- **Preserving Childhood**: Our priority is ensuring that therapy never comes at the expense of being a kid.
- **Family Integration**: We design interventions that fit naturally into your existing family life, rather than disrupting it.

#### Meaningful Outcomes
True success isn't measured by how well a child follows instructions; it is measured by their quality of life. We prioritize interventions that lead to **long-term positive outcomes**—such as independence, happiness, and self-advocacy—rather than focusing on mere compliance.
- **Strengths-Based**: Every plan is built around your child’s unique abilities and potential.
- **Future-Focused**: We teach skills that will serve your child well into adulthood, fostering autonomy and confidence.

#### Community-Centered
Raising a neurodivergent child can sometimes feel isolating. We actively facilitate **family gatherings and events** designed to encourage mutual support among parents and siblings.
- **Shared Experience**: Gatherings that provide a safe space to share lived experiences and normalize the challenges families face.
- **Village of Support**: We help build a network where families can celebrate wins and lean on one another during tough times.

#### Quality over Quantity
In an industry often driven by high volume, we take a different path. We maintain a ***realistic and manageable clinician-to-client ratio**. This ensures that our supervisors and therapists are never stretched too thin and can provide the deep, focused attention your child deserves.
- **Personalized Attention**: Lower caseloads allow us to be truly responsive to the changing needs of your child.
- **Consistency**: A manageable workload reduces burnout, leading to more consistent and reliable care for your family.

#### Self-Directed Learning
We believe that intrinsic motivation is the most powerful driver of learning. Rather than forcing a curriculum, we focus on your child’s specific interests—whether that is trains, space, art, or animals—and use those passions as the bridge to teaching new skills. When a child is engaged in what they love, learning becomes a joy rather than a chore.

#### Yoli’s Non-Profit Model
As a non-profit organization, our bottom line is your child’s well-being, not shareholder returns. This model allows us to foster a **high-quality, supportive work environment** for our staff.
- **Investing in People**: We pour our resources back into continuous professional development for our team.
- **Exceptional Care**: By taking care of our clinicians, we ensure an exceptional caliber of clinical staff is available to support your family.

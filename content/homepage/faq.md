{{< details "What does starting behavioral intervention look like?" >}}
We will begin with an initial 15 min phone call to determine if Yoli is a good fit for your family.

##### INITIAL MEETING 
We will meet to complete an intake package that will help you learn about our services. This is a good time to ask questions to better understand the nature of the behavioral interventions we offer. 

##### INTAKE MEETING 
We will meet to complete and discuss some intake questions that will help us learn about your child and your family. We will also discuss any behavior(s) that you are seeking help with. This will help us deepen our understanding of the processes that trigger, control, and maintain the behavior.

##### EVALUATION
Observation is a key component to understanding behavior. It is especially helpful if we can see the behavior on several different occasions. We will come and observe your child at the time and place that is most relevant and most likely for the behavior to occur. We may also ask that you share some video recordings through a secure link, so that we can observe the behavior further. When possible,  we will try to observe your child in two different environments. We will also meet with your child to conduct a direct assessment that we will use to inform their individualized intervention and the course of their treatment.

##### TREATMENT PLAN
Using the information we have gathered, we will develop a written plan. We will review the behavior plan together and ensure that we are in agreement about how to proceed as well as work out any concerns or barriers to implementation that you may foresee.

##### TREATMENT 
We will work together to implement the behavior treatment plan. This means that you and your clinical team, composed of a Clinical Supervisor and Therapist, and overseen by a BCBA, will work collaboratively to implement the intervention plan. Your child will have regularly scheduled sessions at Yoli’s playspace (or out in the community depending on need) in which they engage in play-based and self-motivated activities. The clinical team will involve you, the parents / caregivers, by modeling interventions and helping you to practice these so that you can implement them consistently with your child outside of sessions. The number of hours and sessions your child will receive will depend on the initial assessment.

##### FOLLOW-UP
Regular monthly clinical meetings will take place with the Clinical Supervisor / BCBA in order to review your child’s progress. During these meetings, you will review data that has been collected by your child’s therapist on the various skills targeted for intervention. The supervisor / BCBA will use these data to make recommendations and determine progress.

{{< details "What is Self-Directed Learning (SDL) / Self-Directed Education (SDE)?" >}}
It simply means focusing on your child’s **interests** and on the way that they learn best, **trusting them** to take the lead in deciding what, how, and when they learn. It involves creating an environment that works best for your child, one in which they are motivated to learn. This way of learning is based on the principles of **intrinsic motivation** for which research has shown not only **enhanced learning outcomes** but also **greater long-term life satisfaction** and personal well-being.

{{< details "What is Applied Behavior Analysis or ABA?" >}}
**Applied Behavior Analysis** (**ABA**) is the science of human behavior. Its methods are empirically validated and it is regarded as a long-standing method for changing human behavior. It involves the principles of learning theory and its main focus is to increase desired behaviors, generalize learned behaviors or reduce undesirable behaviors. Applied behavior analysis has a longstanding robust body of research supporting its efficacy especially as it relates to the treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder but it can also be applied to other populations and to almost any behavior.

{{< details "How can these two approaches work together?" >}}
**Applied Behavior Analysis** (**ABA**) and **Self-Directed Learning** (**SDL**) share a love of natural environments. Both place the utmost emphasis on the quality, richness and power of the environment in which a child lives. ABA and SDL look at how you can change the environment to best fit the child’s learning style instead of focusing on the child’s “bad” behavior.

{{< details "Does behavior change mean changing my child?" >}}
Absolutely not. On the contrary! The approach at Yoli focuses on **acceptance of every child as they are**. This concept is key to moving forward and making changes. Underlying acceptance is the **cessation of comparison to other children** and **seeing and accepting them for where they are in their developmental journey**. Behavior is one of the ways in which children communicate. Often, they are communicating that they lack the skills necessary to navigate a situation. Together we will find functional replacement behaviors and prioritize skill building.

{{< details "How much does it cost?" >}}
**With Insurance**: Your cost is determined by your specific insurance plan. We recommend contacting your insurance to ask about your benefits for therapy, such as co-pays, deductibles, or reimbursement rates. We are happy to help you navigate this process.

**Without Insurance / Sliding Scale**: We are deeply committed to working with socioeconomically diverse families and believe cost should not be a barrier to care. If you do not have insurance, or if your plan's costs are too high, Yoli offers a sliding fee scale based on family needs. We strive to not turn anyone away due to financial hardship.

Please feel comfortable reaching out to us via our [contact form](https://forms.gle/EFY2tqJVWx2terSu5). We can discuss your specific situation and find a path forward.

You’ve been told you have to be a "therapist first, parent second." We believe that’s wrong.

### Trust Your Gut
{{< figure src="../images/Parent-First.jpeg" width="300px" alt="Child playing with a train with their mom in Albany, CA" class="right" >}} If therapy feels rigid, cold, or forceful, it’s not right for your child. You shouldn't have to dread driving to the clinic, and your child shouldn't have to cry through sessions to "learn."

At Yoli, we practice **Connection Before Correction**. We believe that children learn best when they feel safe, loved, and understood—not when they are actively fighting for autonomy.

### A New Way Forward
- **No Withholding**: We never withhold affection, comfort items, or sensory needs to gain compliance.
- **Parent Partnership**: You are the expert on your child. We coach you on how to support them naturally, not how to run drills.
- **Joy-Based**: We use the things they already love (trains, mud, music!) to teach new skills, so therapy feels like play.

### Let’s Bring the Peace Back
We are a nonprofit serving **Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Kensington and surrounding areas**.

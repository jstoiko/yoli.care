You’ve been told you have to be a "therapist first, parent second." We believe that’s wrong.

### Trust Your Gut
{{< figure src="../images/Parent-First.jpeg" width="512px" alt="Child playing with a train with their mom in Albany, CA" class="right" >}} If therapy feels rigid, cold, or forceful, then that’s counter to a child’s natural development and may even hinder growth. You shouldn't have to dread driving to the clinic.
- **Connection Before Correction**: We believe children learn best when they feel safe and understood—not when they are fighting for autonomy.
- **No Tears Required**: We prove that effective therapy can be joyful, using your child's natural interests to build skills without the battle.

### A New Way Forward
- **No Withholding**: We never withhold affection, comfort items, or sensory needs to gain compliance.
- **Parent Partnership**: You are the expert on your child. We coach you on how to support them naturally, not how to run drills.
- **Joy-Based**: We use the things they already love (trains, mud, music!) to teach new skills, so therapy feels like play.

In an industry increasingly owned by private equity firms, Yoli stands apart. We are a **501(c)(3) nonprofit**. We answer to families, not shareholders.

### Why the Model Matters
{{< figure src="../images/Non-Profit.jpeg" width="512px" alt="Child engaged in play-based ABA therapy session in Albany" class="right" >}} The "big box" clinic model often relies on high turnover, overloaded staff, and pushing for 40 hours of therapy a week regardless of need. We reject that model.
- **Mission Over Margin**: Every decision we make is driven by what’s best for your child, not what increases shareholder value.
- **Stability for Families**: By treating our clinicians well, we ensure they stay—giving your child the consistent, long-term relationships they need to thrive.

### The Yoli Standard
- **Low Caseloads**: Our supervisors have drastically smaller caseloads than the industry average, ensuring they truly know your child.
- **Clinician-Led**: Clinical decisions are made by Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), not by business metrics.
- **Ethical Hours**: We prescribe hours based on what is medically necessary and sustainable for your family life—not what maximizes billing.

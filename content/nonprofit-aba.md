In an industry increasingly owned by private equity firms, Yoli stands apart. We are a **501(c)(3) nonprofit**. We answer to families, not shareholders.

### Why the Model Matters
{{< figure src="../images/Non-Profit.jpeg" width="300px" alt="Child engaged in play-based ABA therapy session in Albany" class="right" >}} The "big box" clinic model often relies on high turnover, overloaded staff, and pushing for 40 hours of therapy a week regardless of need. We reject that model.

### The Yoli Standard
- **Low Caseloads**: Our supervisors have drastically smaller caseloads than the industry average, ensuring they truly know your child.
- **Clinician-Led**: Clinical decisions are made by Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), not by business metrics.
- **Ethical Hours**: We prescribe hours based on what is medically necessary and sustainable for your family life—not what maximizes billing.

### Join Our Village
We are currently accepting new families in **Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Kensington and surrounding areas**.

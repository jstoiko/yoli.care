Where therapy feels like play, and learning is a joy—not a chore.

### The "Yoli" Difference: Kids First
{{< figure src="../images/therapy-session.jpg" width="512px" alt="Child engaged in play-based ABA therapy session in Albany" class="right" >}} Standard ABA can feel rigid. We take a different path. We practice a neurodiversity-affirming, play-based form of Applied Behavior Analysis that honors the dignity of every child. Our priority is ensuring that therapy never comes at the expense of being a child.
- **Strengths-Based**: We build plans around your child's unique abilities.
- **Child-Led**: We use your child's passions—whether trains, space, or art—as the bridge to teaching new skills.

### Quality Over Quantity
In an industry often driven by high volume, we refuse to cut corners.
- **Low Caseloads**: We maintain a realistic clinician-to-client ratio so your therapist is never stretched too thin.
- **Consistency**: A manageable workload reduces burnout, meaning more reliable care for your family.

### More Than Therapy—A Village
Raising a neurodivergent child can feel isolating, but you don't have to do it alone.
- **Community**: We facilitate family gatherings to encourage mutual support among parents and siblings.
- **Non-Profit Mission**: As a non-profit, our bottom line is your child’s well-being, not shareholder returns.

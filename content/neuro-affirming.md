Traditional ABA often focuses on making autistic kids appear "indistinguishable from their peers." We focus on helping them be their best, authentic selves.

### The Anti-Burnout Approach
{{< figure src="../images/Neuro-Affirming.jpeg" width="512px" alt="Happy child running at a park near Albany / Berkeley" class="right" >}} We know that masking (hiding autistic traits) leads to severe burnout and anxiety. Our goal is **Skill-Building, not compliance.**
- **Authenticity First**: We help children understand and advocate for their needs, rather than training them to hide who they are.
- **Sustainable Growth**: We focus on regulation and independence—skills that improve quality of life long-term, not just immediate compliance.

### How We Honor Neurodivergence
- **Stimming is Okay**: We respect sensory regulation (stimming) and never target harmless behaviors for reduction.
- **Consent Matters**: We teach children that their "no" matters. We never use force to gain compliance. When we do use physical prompting, it is gentle and supportive—used only to help a child succeed without frustration, enhance enjoyment, and build internal motivation for activities they might otherwise struggle to complete.
- **Trauma-Informed**: We recognize the history of harm in our field and actively work to repair it through transparent, ethical practices.

Where social skills mean connection, not compliance & scripting.

### Finally, a Social Group That Feels Like Play (Because It Is)

{{< figure src="../images/social-play-group.jpg" width="512px" alt="Children playing together cooperatively in a sensory-friendly space" class="right" >}}

Many "social skills groups" feel like classrooms: scripted conversations, rote drills, rule-based interactions and forced eye contact. For neurodivergent kids, this often teaches masking, not connection.

At Yoli, we do things differently. Our **East Bay Social Skills Group** is a facilitated play space where children learn to navigate friendships authentically—through shared interests, collaborative play, and mutual respect. And above all, we do so at the child’s pace.

- **Authentic Connection**: We don't teach kids to "act neurotypical." We help them find their tribe and communicate their needs.
- **Child-Led Themes**: If the group loves trains, we build a transit system. If they love space, we become astronauts. Shared joy builds the strongest bonds.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Disagreements happen. We guide children through real-time problem solving, teaching negotiation and perspective-taking in the moment.

### Who Is This Group For?

Our groups are designed for neurodivergent children (Autism, ADHD, Gifted/2e) in **Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, and surrounding East Bay areas** who:

- Want to make friends but struggle with the "how."
- Feel overwhelmed in large, unstructured school recesses.
- Benefit from a smaller, sensory-aware environment.
- Thrive when connecting over shared passions (LEGOs, Minecraft, art, science).

### The "Anti-Drill" Approach

We believe social skills are about **understanding others**, not just performing for them.

- **Double Empathy**: We teach that communication is a two-way street. We help kids understand neurotypical norms *without* enforcing them as the only "right" way to be.
- **Sensory Safety**: A regulated child is a social child. Our clinic offers sensory swings, a trampoline, quiet corners, and fidgets to help kids stay regulated while they play.
- **Clinician-Led**: Groups are facilitated by experienced behavior technicians and overseen by a BCBA, ensuring every child gets the support they need to succeed.

### Logistics & Enrollment

- **Location**: Yoli Center, 1057 Solano Ave, Albany, CA.
- **Format**: Small groups (matched by age and communication style).
- **Commitment**: Weekly sessions to build consistency and trust.

### Ready to Find Their Tribe?

We are currently forming new cohorts. If you're looking for a **social skills group in the East Bay** that honors your child's unique way of connecting, we'd love to meet you.

{{< figure src="../images/laura.png" width="150" alt="Laura Kliger" class="left" >}}
> Hello. I am a **Board Certified Behavior Analyst** (**BCBA**) with an insatiable passion for child development and self-directed learning. I have been working in many settings (homes, schools, clinics and in the community) with children of all ages. I have been supporting parents, teachers, and therapists to better understand and manage behaviors. My passion is to help parents reclaim their role; to understand their child’s behavior and to make changes that allow the family to live in a more cohesive and symbiotic way. -- *Laura Kliger, BCBA, MADS*

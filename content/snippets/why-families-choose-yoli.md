### Why Families Choose Yoli
| Traditional / For-Profit ABA | The **Yoli** Way |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| **Prioritizes billable hours** over meaningful outcomes | **Prioritizes your child's well-being** — we're a nonprofit, not driven by shareholder returns |
| **High therapist caseloads** (30+ clients per BCBA) lead to burnout and inconsistent care | **Low, manageable caseloads** so your therapist can give focused, personalized attention |
| **Compliance-focused:** Teaching children to follow instructions and conform to social norms | **Autonomy-focused:** Building independence, self-advocacy, and honoring neurodiversity |
| **Curriculum-driven:** One-size-fits-all programs | **Child-led learning:** We follow your child's interests (trains, art, space) to teach new skills |
| **Table-time drills** that can feel like work | **Play-based sessions** where learning happens through joy |
| **High staff turnover** (the best clinicians leave or go out-of-network) | **Stable, passionate team** — we retain top clinicians with competitive pay and healthy workloads |
| **Leadership with little clinical expertise** focused on growth and profits | **BCBA-led organization** committed to clinical excellence and ethical practice |
| **Families feel like customers** in a transactional relationship | **Families become part of a supportive community** with regular family gatherings |

For neurodivergent kids, a park isn't just a playground—it's a sensory regulation station. But not all parks are created equal. Some are too loud, some lack shade, and some are just... boring.

Here are our top 5 local picks for seeking input, finding calm, and burning energy.

### 1. Ocean View Park (Albany)

**The Vibe:** The "Redwood Refuge"  
**Best For:** Proprioception (Heavy Work) & Calm  
**Why we love it:** The giant wooden structures offer great climbing (heavy work) for kids who need to crash and bang. But the secret weapon is the redwood grove behind the field. It’s quiet, shaded, and perfect for a child who needs a "reset" from the noise of the playground.

### 2. Adventure Playground (Berkeley Marina)

**The Vibe:** Controlled Chaos  
**Best For:** Tactile (Touch) & Creative Agency  
**Why we love it:** It’s a junk playground where kids build forts, paint, and use real tools. It is messy, muddy, and chaotic—in the best way. For kids who crave tactile input (sand, water, paint) and need to feel in control of their environment, this is paradise.  
*⚠️ Warning: Not for kids who are easily overwhelmed by visual clutter.*

### 3. Codornices Park (Berkeley)

**The Vibe:** The Big Slide  
**Best For:** Vestibular (Movement/Balance)  
**Why we love it:** The famous concrete slide. It provides intense vestibular input (speed/movement) that can be incredibly regulating for sensory seekers. Plus, the creek tunnel offers a cool, echoey auditory experience for kids who love sound play.  
*📍 [1201 Euclid Ave, Berkeley](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Codornices+Park&query_place_id=ChIJGxW97Rx8hYARrmWBykD0ryE)*

### 4. Castro Park (El Cerrito)

{{< figure src="castro.jpg" alt="Castro Park" class="right" height="200px" >}}

**The Vibe:** The "Safe Container"  
**Best For:** Elopers & Social Observers  
**Why we love it:** It’s fully fenced (mostly). The ground surface is rubberized (great for toe-walkers or stability issues), and the layout allows parents to sit in the middle and see the entire perimeter. It’s a low-anxiety park for parents of runners.  
*📍 [1420 Norvell St, El Cerrito](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Castro+Park&query_place_id=ChIJk5CbeTh5hYAR8Ned0EdbCKM)*

### 5. Dracena Quarry Park (Piedmont/Oakland border)

{{< figure src="dracena.jpg" alt="Dracena Quarry Park" class="right" height="200px" >}}

**The Vibe:** The "Scooter Bowl"  
**Best For:** Linear Movement & containment  
**Why we love it:** It’s built into an old quarry, so it feels enclosed and safe. The paved loop is perfect for scooters or pacing (stimming). The climbing wall is massive, offering great deep pressure input for older kids who have outgrown "tot" structures.

If you live in the Bay Area, you have likely heard this sentence:
*"We are accepting new patients, but our waitlist for an assessment is 9 to 12 months."*. Sometimes the provider will conduct an initial ABA Assessment and keep you waiting with remote "Parent Training" here and there while keeping you on a waitlist for actual ABA Therapy for sometimes up to 24 months.

You might think you have no choice but to wait.
**Under California law, you do not.**

The **Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act** guarantees your right to *Timely Access to Care*. This law is your most powerful tool to bypass month-long waitlists and get your child the support they need *now*—often with an Out-of-Network provider (like Yoli) paid for by your insurance at the In-Network rate.

Here is law followed by a playbook on how to use it.

## The Law: The "15-Day Rule"
California regulations (enforced by the **Department of Managed Health Care** or **DMHC**) state that health plans must provide an appointment with a specialist within **15 business days** of a request. **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) / Behavioral Health Treatment (BHT)** is a specialist service.

If your insurance plan cannot offer you an appointment with an *available* In-Network provider within that 15-day window, they are legally out of compliance.

**The Remedy:** If the network is inadequate, the plan **must** authorize an Out-of-Network provider to deliver the service, usually through a **Single Case Agreement (SCA)**.

---

## The Trap: "Medical Necessity" vs. "Availability"
Insurance companies often try to deny Single Case Agreements by saying, *"We have other providers in network."*. They will send you a list of 50 names. They won't tell you that 48 of them are full, 1 is retired, and 1 is on maternity leave.

**Do not argue about methodology.**
Do not say, *"I want Yoli because they are play-based and neuro-affirming."*
Insurance companies do not care about philosophy. They view ABA as a generic medical service (CPT codes 97151/97153). If you argue "fit," they will say, *"We have other providers who can do ABA."*

**Argue exclusively about TIMELINE.**
Say, *"I want Yoli because they are the ONLY provider who can see my child within the legal 15-day window."*

## The Playbook: How to Trigger an SCA

### Step 1: The Waitlist Log (Gather Evidence)
You cannot just *say* there are waitlists. You must *prove* it.
1.  Take the list of In-Network providers your insurance gave you.
2.  Call 3-5 of them.
3.  Ask: *"What is your waitlist for [Assessment OR Ongoing Therapy]?"*
4.  **Write it down.** Create a simple log:
    *   **Provider Name** | **Date Called** | **Wait Time Stated**
    *   *Example:* "ABC Therapy | 2/25/26 | 9-12 months"

### Step 2: The Demand Call (Trigger the Law)
Once you have your log showing no availability within 15 days, call your insurance plan’s **Member Services** number.

**Script:**
> "I have a prescription for ABA therapy for my child. Under California’s Timely Access to Care laws, you are required to provide a specialist appointment within 15 business days.
>
> I have called 5 providers on your list. **All of them have waitlists exceeding [X] months.** (Read your log if asked).
>
> You are failing to provide Network Adequacy. I have identified an available provider (**Yoli** or another available provider) who is ready to start [Assessment/Therapy] immediately.
>
> **I am requesting a Single Case Agreement (SCA) for Yoli to provide care at my in-network cost-sharing rate.**
>
> If you cannot provide an in-network appointment within 15 days or authorize this SCA, I will file a grievance with the **Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC)** today."

**Why this works:** A DMHC grievance costs the plan time, money, and regulatory scrutiny. They want to avoid it.

### Step 3: The Follow-Through
If the representative hesitates or says "we'll look into it," ask for a **Case Number** and the **Fax Number** for the Claims/Prior Authorization department.

**Then, contact us immediately.**
We will provide you with the "Support Packet" to fax or email to them:
1.  Letter of Medical Necessity (from your doctor/pediatrician).
2.  Yoli’s NPI & Tax ID (W-9).
3.  Our confirmation that we have immediate availability.

## Scenarios: Where Are You Stuck?

### Scenario A: Starting from Scratch (No Assessment)
*   **The Problem:** You have a diagnosis, but haven't started. Every clinic says "Assessment waitlist: 6 months."
*   **The Goal:** Getting the **Initial Assessment (CPT 97151)** authorized.
*   **Your Argument:** *"My child has a medical diagnosis and no treatment plan. A 6-month wait for an assessment delays care illegally."*

### Scenario B: "Assessment Limbo" (Plan Done, No Therapist)
*   **The Problem:** You have an Assessment and a Treatment Plan, but the agency says, *"We don't have staff. We'll call you when an RBT is available."*
*   **The Trap:** Insurance often considers "Assessment Complete" as "Access Met."
*   **The Counter:** *"Access to care means TREATMENT, not just paperwork. My child is authorized for 15 hours/week and is receiving zero. The provider is unable to fulfill the prescription. I need an SCA for a provider who has staff ready NOW."*

**Remember:** You are not asking for a favor. You are demanding your legal right to timely healthcare.

If you live in the Bay Area, you have likely encountered one of these two scenarios:

- **The Assessment Barrier:** *"We are accepting new patients, but our waitlist for an initial assessment is 9 to 12 months."*

- **The Treatment Limbo:** *"We have completed your child's assessment, but we do not have a technician available to start therapy. You are on our waitlist for services, which is currently 12 to 24 months."*

In many cases, a provider will conduct an initial assessment just to "claim" you as a client, then leave you in limbo—offering occasional remote "Parent Training" while you wait years for actual, in-person ABA therapy.

You might think you have no choice but to wait.
**Under California law, you do not.**

The **Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act** guarantees your right to *Timely Access to Care*. This law is your most powerful tool to bypass month-long waitlists and get your child the support they need *now*—often with an Out-of-Network provider (like Yoli) paid for by your insurance at the In-Network rate.

## The Law: The "15-Day Rule" & "10-Day Rule"
California regulations (enforced by the **Department of Managed Health Care** or **DMHC**) provide strict timelines for access to care:

*   **15 Business Days:** Health plans must provide an appointment with a specialist (like your **Initial ABA Assessment**) within 15 business days of a request.
*   **10 Business Days:** Under **SB 221** (effective July 2022), non-physician mental health follow-up appointments (like **ongoing ABA therapy sessions**) must be offered within 10 business days.

If your insurance plan cannot offer you an appointment with an *available* In-Network provider within these windows, they are legally out of compliance.

### Know Your Regulator
Most California plans are regulated by the **DMHC**. However, if your plan is a **PPO** through a large employer (self-insured), you might be regulated by the **California Department of Insurance (CDI)** or federal ERISA law. Check your insurance card—if it mentions "CDI," file your complaint there.

**The Remedy:** If the network is inadequate, the plan **must** authorize an Out-of-Network provider to deliver the service. They might call it a **Single Case Agreement (SCA)** or a **Letter of Agreement (LOA)**, but the name doesn't matter—only the authorization matters.

## The Trap: "Medical Necessity" vs. "Availability"
Insurance companies often try to deny Single Case Agreements by saying, *"We have other providers in network."*. They will send you a list of 50 names. They won't tell you that 48 of them are full, 1 is retired, and 1 is on maternity leave.

**Do not argue about methodology.**
Do not say, *"I want Yoli because they are play-based and neuro-affirming."*
Insurance companies do not care about philosophy. They view ABA as a generic medical service (CPT codes 97151/97153). If you argue "fit," they will say, *"We have other providers who can do ABA."*

**Argue exclusively about TIMELINE.**
Say, *"I want Yoli because they are the ONLY provider who can see my child within the legal 15-day window."*

## The Playbook: How to Trigger an SCA

### Step 1: The Waitlist Log (Gather Evidence)
You cannot just *say* there are waitlists. You must *prove* it.
1.  Take the list of In-Network providers your insurance gave you.
2.  Call 3-5 of them.
3.  Ask: *"What is your waitlist for [Assessment OR Ongoing Therapy]?"*
4.  **Write it down.** Create a simple log:
    *   **Provider Name** | **Date Called** | **Wait Time Stated**
    *   *Example:* "ABC Therapy | 2/25/26 | 9-12 months"

### Step 2: The Demand Call (Trigger the Law)
Once you have your log showing no availability within 15 days, call your insurance plan’s **Member Services** number.

**Script:**
> "I have a prescription for ABA therapy for my child. Under California’s Timely Access to Care laws, you are required to provide a specialist appointment within 15 business days (or 10 days for ongoing therapy per SB 221).
>
> I have called 5 providers on your list. **All of them have waitlists exceeding [X] months.** (Read your log if asked).
>
> You are failing to provide Network Adequacy. I have identified a provider, **Yoli**, who has an immediate opening and can begin services within the legal timeline.
>
> **I am requesting that you authorize them as an out-of-network provider to meet your Timely Access obligations.** Please confirm this will be at my in-network cost-sharing rate.
>
> Please provide me with a case number for this request and the direct fax number for your Single Case Agreement department. If you cannot authorize this, I will file a grievance with the **Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC)** today."

**Why this works:** A DMHC grievance costs the plan time, money, and regulatory scrutiny. They want to avoid it.

### Step 3: The Follow-Through
If the representative hesitates or says "we'll look into it," ask for a **Case Number** and the **Fax Number** for the Claims/Prior Authorization department.

**Then, contact us immediately.**
We will provide you with the "Support Packet" to fax or email to them:
1.  Letter of Medical Necessity (from your doctor/pediatrician).
2.  Yoli’s NPI & Tax ID (W-9).
3.  Our confirmation that we have immediate availability.

### Step 4: The Escalation (If They Stall or Deny)
If the insurance company denies your request or fails to resolve the issue, you must formally escalate. **Do not skip the Health Plan Grievance step**, or the DMHC may send you back to the start.

**1. File a Formal Grievance with the Health Plan**
*   **Action:** Submit a written grievance (online or via mail) titled: **"Formal Grievance: Failure to Provide Timely Access to Care."**
*   **The Clock:** Once filed, the plan has **30 calendar days** to resolve it.
*   **The "Urgent" Exception:** If the delay is causing a serious threat to your child’s health (e.g., severe regression, self-injury, dangerous behaviors), mark the grievance as **"URGENT / EXPEDITED."** The plan must respond within **72 hours**.

**2. File a Complaint with the DMHC**
You can file a complaint with the **DMHC Help Center** if:
*   The plan denies your grievance (in writing).
*   The plan fails to resolve it within 30 days.
*   The situation is **Urgent** (immediate threat to health) and the plan hasn't acted within 72 hours.

**How to File:**
*   **Website:** [HealthHelp.ca.gov](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/FileaComplaint.aspx)
*   **Phone:** 1-888-466-2219
*   **What to Attach:** Your "Waitlist Log," your denial letter/grievance number, and the letter from Yoli confirming availability.

## Scenarios: Where Are You Stuck?

### Scenario A: Starting from Scratch (No Assessment)
*   **The Problem:** You have a diagnosis, but haven't started. Every clinic says "Assessment waitlist: 6 months."
*   **The Goal:** Getting the **Initial Assessment (CPT 97151)** authorized.
*   **Your Argument:** *"My child has a medical diagnosis and no treatment plan. A 6-month wait for an assessment delays care illegally."*

### Scenario B: "Assessment Limbo" (Plan Done, No Therapist)
*   **The Problem:** You have an Assessment and a Treatment Plan, but the agency says, *"We don't have staff. We'll call you when an RBT is available."*
*   **The Trap:** Insurance often considers "Assessment Complete" as "Access Met."
*   **The Counter:** *"Access to care means TREATMENT, not just paperwork. My child has a medical prescription for [X] hours per week starting now. If your network cannot fulfill the hours prescribed by the doctor within **10 business days**, you are in violation of **SB 221**. I need an authorization for a provider who has staff ready NOW."*

**Warning: Protect Your Wallet**
Ensure the insurance company confirms in writing (or on a recorded line) that the SCA will be processed at **In-Network cost-sharing levels**. This ensures you only pay your standard co-pay/deductible, and not the full out-of-network price.

**Remember:** You are not asking for a favor. You are demanding your legal right to timely healthcare.

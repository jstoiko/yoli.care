If you are a Regional Center of the East Bay (RCEB) family, you might have heard a Case Manager say: *"We are referring you to [Provider X]."*

It often sounds like an assignment. It sounds like you don't have a choice.

**But under the California Lanterman Act, you do.**

The law that established the Regional Center system was built on the principle of *consumer and family choice*. You are not just a recipient of services; you are the driver of your child's support team.

## The Magic Words: "Consumer Choice"
If you have found a provider that aligns with your family’s values—for example, a play-based, neurodiversity-affirming clinic like Yoli—you have the right to request them specifically.

Here is how to advocate for that choice during your Individual Program Plan (IPP) meeting:

### Step 1: Do Your Research First
Before your meeting, contact the provider you want. Ask them:

*   *"Are you vendorized with RCEB?"* (Yoli is)
*   *"Do you have current availability or a waitlist?"*
*   *"Can you give me a fierce advocacy letter or intake summary?"*

### Step 2: Focus on "Fit", Not Just Availability
RCEB often prioritizes the first available slot. You need to explain why that **specific provider** is the necessary fit for your child. Regional Centers are legally required to choose the "least costly provider of comparable service". Your job is to **prove that the two providers are NOT comparable**. You must explain why your child's specific medical and emotional needs require Yoli’s exact model.

*   **Wrong way:** *"We heard Yoli is nice."*
*   **Right way:** *"My child has a high need for naturalistic, play-based instruction. We require a provider that specializes in child-led therapy to prevent the emotional dysregulation we've seen with table-top ABA. Yoli’s clinical model fits this medical need; the other provider’s DTT model does not."*

### Step 3: Use the "IPP Amendment" Strategy
If you are already with a provider that isn't working, you don't have to wait a year. You can call an IPP meeting at any time to request a change, and by law, the Regional Center must hold the meeting within **30 days** of your request.

*   **What to say:** *"The current vendor’s approach is causing distress and is not the 'least restrictive environment' for my child. We have identified a vendor (Yoli) whose methodology is better suited to his sensory profile. We would like to switch authorizations effective immediately."*

### Step 4: Be the squeaky wheel (politely)
Case managers are overworked. If they say *"I'll check"*, follow up weekly.

*   **What to ask:** *"Checking in on the authorization for Yoli. We have spoken to them and they are ready to schedule the assessment as soon as they receive the POS (Purchase of Service)."*

If the Case Manager flat-out denies your provider request, tell them: *"I understand. Please send me a written Notice of Action (NOA) for this denial"*. Often, simply asking for the NOA will cause a supervisor to review and approve the request to avoid an appeal process.

**Remember:** The Regional Center pays for the service, but *you* are the expert on your child.
